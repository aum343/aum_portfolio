    <h3>Parkour System</h3>
    <p>
    This project showcases expertise in dynamic animation manipulation, physics simulation, problem-solving, precise calculations, and motion blending. The player's ability to execute a slide during sprinting, seamlessly reverting to a walking state upon front leg collision detection, exemplifies advanced motion control techniques. Jumping mechanics are meticulously executed through sophisticated calculations involving distance, object height, and length, triggering appropriate animations for seamless integration. Furthermore, the project emphasizes the foundational importance of line tracing techniques, highlighting its core role in gameplay mechanics.
